### Facade

### Observer
The primary goal of the observer pattern is to handle 
one-to-many relationships, where one object (the subject) 
notifies multiple observers about changes in its state. 
Those observers subscribe to recieve updates but do not
actively interact through a central point. This in comparison
to the mediator pattern is inherently different considering that
with the mediator pattern the primary goal is to centralize and
manage complex interactions between multiple objects, allowing them
to communicate without directly referencing each other.
