# Polynomials

Terms are mathematical expressions that are made up of number and a variable part. This looks as follows: $2x$ the number part is the coefficient the second part, the $x$ is the variable part, this can be anything i.e. $a^2b^3$ etc

Now that we know what a term is we can determine that a polynomial is a chain of terms either added or subtracted from each other.

$$
3x^2+x-5
$$

The above mentioned is a polynomial however as we can see above there is no variable part to the 5. We can state that there is an $x$ as well however this $x$ is an $x^0$ which is equal to $1$. If we would write the above statemen completely correct it would look like this:

$$
3x^2+1x-5x^0
$$
